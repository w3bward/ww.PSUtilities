This module contains relatively simple but generally useful functions and cmdlets with minimal dependencies. The tools in this module are ones that I find myself using in other more specialized scripts and modules.

This project is also serves as a personal proof of concept including authoring cmdlets in C# and including them in a module alongside functions.
