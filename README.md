This module contains relatively simple but generally useful functions and cmdlets with minimal dependencies. The tools in this module are ones that I find myself using in other more specialized scripts and modules.

This is also a personal proof of concept for including binary modules/cmdlets alongside script functions.

Thanks to Simon Wahlin for allowing me to include the code from his random password generator in the New-RandomPassword function. His original blog post can be found [here](https://blog.simonw.se/powershell-generating-random-password-for-active-directory/).
